Todo:  
    * [STVCHOST]Add requirement for the fmw to first isolate all srvies (1 dll - 1 executable) (look for the powerhsell script.)
        * Test this to ensure how the dlls are loaded (are there anyones that are always loaded?) 
        * will kc help us?
    * Disclaimer: ALl the information gathered is realted to the performance of the system
    * Disclaimer: Also the time that it runs  (ley de grandes numeros. 1 day running should normalize differnce of performance in the seconds/minutes scale)
    * Search for the font and logo of ernw on the shared servers (data1, data3)
