# Ideas

## To detect where the security providers are writting from. 
* Intercept registrations and writes and figure out from where they've been performed. 
* Find a way to search for GUIDS structures inside binaries (YARA?) and maybe search for them in the system-related directories. 
* Powershell command who exrecute each some time the command to see which proviersd are registreed. Try to idnertify all of them.
* 
## To detect who is taking into account the level
* Look for this string "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection" (Yara)
* Look for this string "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows" (Yara)
